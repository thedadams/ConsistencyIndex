## ConsistencyIndex

A Java program that implemets my Consistency Index baseball statistic.  The code is not commented because the stat is written and designed by me.  It comes in two flavors: On Base Consistency Index and Hitting Consistency Index.  If you would like more information without looking through the possibly incomprehensible source, please do not hesitate to contact me.  The source was written, and the repository created, using Netbeans IDE.

## Liscence

The Consistency Indices were designed solely by me.  The code was also completely written by me using Netbeans IDE.  The files in the "CompiledFiles" folder are produced using the files provided by Retrosheet [here](http://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm).  I coded a small PHP script that pulled the desired data from the Retrosheet files.  I only ask that you contact me if you are going to use, modify, or distribute the source code or compiled programs.
